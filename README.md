# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Synopsis
An analysis of Kickstarter data was perfomed to uncover trends in crowdfunding campaigns with a special emphasis on theatrical plays. The objective was to provide budgetary guidance based on historical performance with crowdfunding donations, successes and failures with a primary focus on Great Britian (GB)and the United States (US).
## Findings
### Average Donations
The were a total of 4,113 Kickstarter campaigns that were created globally between May of 2009 and March of 2017, of these 1,066 were used to raise money for theatrical plays. To break things down further, there were 412 successful Kickstarters for the US and 238 in GB. The total number of backers for sucessful campaigns in GB was 11,094, with an average donation of around $54.00. The total number of backers for successful US campaigns was 25,994, with an average donation of around $93.00. The findings demonstrate that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May.
### Fundraising Details
It was noted that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects.
