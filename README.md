# Kickstarting with Excel - IN PROGESS
## Overview of Project 
### Purpose
This analysis was performed to help an up and coming playright, who wants to start a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to fund her new play, which will initially be launched in the United States. The playright, Louise, has an estimated budget of over $10,000.00 to be allocated for operating expenses such as sets, costumes, props, makeup, lighting, rehearsal space, advertising, programs and actors. Louise is hesitant about undertaking her first campaign and has aksed for an analysis of Kickstarter campaign data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. She will use the results of the analysis to taylor her own Kickstarter campaign for success. The Kickstarter data set used for this analysis contains information about campaigns that were created globally between May of 2009 and March of 2017. There were a total of 4,113 campains created during this time frame, with 1,066 of them being specific to funding for theatrical plays. Louise would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The focus of this analysis will be on the crowdfunding campaigns for theatrical plays for an apples to apples comparison.
