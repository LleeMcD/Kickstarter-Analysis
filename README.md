# Kickstarting with Excel - IN PROGESS
## Overview of Project 
### Purpose
This analysis was performed to help an up and coming playright, who wants to start a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to fund her new play, which will initially be launched in the United States. The playright, Louise, has an estimated budget of over $10,000.00 to be allocated for operating expenses such as sets, costumes, props, makeup, lighting, rehearsal space, advertising, programs and actors. Louise is hesitant about undertaking her first campaign and has aksed for an analysis of Kickstarter campaign data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. She will use the results of the analysis to taylor her own Kickstarter campaign for success. The Kickstarter data set used for this analysis contains information about campaigns that were created globally between May of 2009 and March of 2017. There were a total of 4,113 campains created during this time frame, with 1,369 of them being specific to the theater, which is the focus of this analysis. An analysis of Kickstarter crowdfunding for theater campaigns based on launch date and outcomes based on goals revealed that there were 1,369 of these campaigns launched between July 19, 2010 and March 15, 2017. The results of the analysis are illustrated in the next sections of this report.
