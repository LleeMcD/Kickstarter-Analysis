# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Synopsis
An analysis of Kickstarter data was perfomed to uncover trends in crowdfunding campaigns with a special emphasis on theatrical plays. The objective was to provide budgetary guidance based on historical performance with crowdfunding donations, successes and failures with a primary focus on Great Britian (GB)and the United States (US).
## Findings
### Average Donations
The were a total of 4,113 Kickstarter campaigns that were created globally between May of 2009 and March of 2017, of these 1,066 were used to raise money for theatrical plays. To break things down further, there were 412 successful Kickstarters for the US and 238 in GB. The total number of backers for sucessful campaigns in GB was 11,094, with an average donation of around $54.00.The total number of backers for successful US campaigns was 25,994, with an average donation of around $93.00.

Overall, the findings demonstrate that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May.

### Fundraising Details and Recommendations
It was noted that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. In addition, the mean and median (middle) pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns may be unsuccessful for other reasons besides cost. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that the price that was asked was just too high for those that failed. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. A $10,000.00 campaign goal for theatrical plays produced in the US is more than twice the average Kickstarter goal and the avarage (mean) Kickstarter campaign goal in GB was around £4,000, which is out of the range of outliers for the amount pledged. Based on these findings, it would be adisable to aim for keeping costs at around $3,000 for plays produced the US and aound £2,000n or less for those produced in GB.
